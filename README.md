# GoodReads
My First Impressions:
GoodReads current website is poorly laid out. There's a lot of content, but it’s confusing. Navigating it isn’t intuitive. The colors are mute, but blend well. The timeline page, although social, doesn’t facilitate adding friends readily, unlike Facebook. The personal profile page & book page are very disorganized & have a lack of hierarchy. I use GoodReads to help me read more & tract my book reading list; I like that it has feedback via reviews, rating, & recommendations.

Asking Others:
I ask some people in our classroom about GoodReads:
1. Do you use GoodReads?
2. How do you like the website?
3. What content/features would you like to see added if the website were redesigned?

-Person one uses GoodReads to track their books & find new ones. Wants it to be more social.
-Person two uses GoodReads to track the books they've read, is a frequent reader. Thinks the site is cluttered and would like the genre of the book to be more apparent. Wants a better recommendation algorithm.
-Person three uses GoodReads to track the books they've read. Wants the website to focus more on groups. Wants more stats and achievements. Wants to know more about the genres reads, authors read, estimated amount of pages read, etc.
-Person four never used GoodReads. Didn’t “get” it.
-Person five uses GoodReads to see what their friends are reading. Doesn’t like the clutter.

Competitors:
GoodReads is ahead of the competition by a long shot, but there are other similar services. Anobli is UK based, their website is much less cluttered. Shelfari is also owned by Amazon. However, feels just as dated & cluttered.Readernaut has a very clean & modern layout, & is very exclusive.

Good Reads SWOT
-Strengths:
Popularity & following: people have probably been using GR for a while and have lots of books tracked.
-Reputation: seen as leader in field.
Vast catalog of books & recommendations.
-Weaknesses:
Poorly designed web app; doesn't feel modern or app like,
It’s difficult to use, not enjoyable & could drive potential new users away
-Opportunities:
Well designed web app
More of a social aspect
Better recommendation algorithm
Make genres more apparent
Make more app-like with badges, accomplishments, etc
-Threats:
A well designed web app comes along before they successfully redesign


Concepts:
Modern App: create badges and achievements, more emphasis on goals
Book Club: more social version of app, focus on groups, friends, & sharing
